this topic got into compilation of real time flags of the Linux kernel for a raspberry pi. 
with this and the kernel books I should be able to

[  ] make a rtos base on the PIs 
[  ] develop a network based RT-GoL in C
     [  ] udp to stream current board info
     [  ] tcp for c2 interrupt/handles on specific time scale (first 10hz maybe?)

[  ] reach goal, wrap or board sharing protocol with other pi rtGoL boxes
[  ] research if multicast would make sense for sensing other instances or keeping up to date at specific tick or rate with other boards

[  ] reach reach goal work to make Minimum Viable rt-container for Conway with Cgroup and namespace to see how many I could run on one RT-PI

[  ] other possible, add hardware interface with meshtastic board and pi out of the box.
