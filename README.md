# Real-Time Container-like Runtime for Distributed Agents

## Overview

A lightweight, real-time-aware container system designed for distributed agents in embedded and industrial environments. This project bridges real-time Linux (PREEMPT_RT) and container orchestration for high-performance, low-latency applications.

## Features

- Real-time scheduling (SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR)
- Resource isolation (CPU, memory, I/O)
- Namespace isolation (PID, Net, Mount, User)
- Extensible CLI and runtime management
- Compatible with BC635/BC637 time cards and 1553 bus hardware
- CI/CD and hardware-in-the-loop simulation ready

## First Application

- Distributed, real-time **Game of Life** agents
